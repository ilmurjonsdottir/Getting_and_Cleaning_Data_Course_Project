The dataset is
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files of repository:
        README.md - introduction of the repository
        Codebook.md - Goes over the data and variables
        run_analysis.R - script for data prep and completes the five steps asked for in the directions
        FinalData.txt - final data after everything
        
These are the directions:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

        1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurememt.
        3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
